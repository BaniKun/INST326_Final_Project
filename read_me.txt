This is the Budget Calendar created by Seungjun (June) Kang and Miriam Hernandez

This calendar allows user to log expenses and incomes and calculate daily recommended budget based on their input.
    Users can also save it and load it back in so that they can keep adding their logs.
    To use the calendar, run the main.py on the terminal. 

The visualizations will appear automatically when specific prompts in main.py are selected, specifically in the income and expense
    checks. All the plots are dependent on the inputted user data. The pie chart may seem as if it is not calculating correctly,
    however it is based on the total expenses without consideration for income. This allows users to solely view their expense distribution
    in case they do not have any income listed. 
visualization.py does NOT have to be run separately, main.py contains all the functionality of the program.
